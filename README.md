# Checkers

Checkers, also known as Draughts, is a timeless board game that has been enjoyed by generations. This implementation of the game is a simple yet engaging version that you can play on your computer. The game is played on an 8x8 board with 12 pieces for each player, which can move diagonally and capture the opponent's pieces by jumping over them.

## How to Play/Run the Program

To get started, all you need to do is download the repository and run the Main.java file using a Java interpreter. You will need to ensure that you have JVM and JRE installed on your machine (which you probably already have).

## Rules

The game is played by two players who take turns moving their pieces. Each player can move their pieces diagonally one square forward, but if they can capture an opponent's piece by jumping over it, they must do so. If a player's piece reaches the other end of the board, it is crowned and can move and capture in any direction, making it more powerful.

The game ends when one player captures all of the other player's pieces. To play the game, simply select a piece by clicking on it with the mouse. The selected piece will be highlighted with a yellow field. To move the piece, drag and drop it to the desired square. All legal moves for the selected piece will be highlighted with a blue field. If you try to move a piece without using a legal move, the move will not be allowed.
